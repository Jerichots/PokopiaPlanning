## Key Mechanics

- **Comfy Level** — Each Pokemon's happiness (Iffy > Average > Nice > Great > Awesome) based on habitat match + favorites
- **Environment Level** — Per-area progression (1–10) driven by aggregate Comfy Levels; unlocks shops, challenges, gifts
- **House Rules** — Max 10x10 blocks, 3+ unique furniture, up to 4 Pokemon per house
- **Map Height** — 127 blocks vertical across all areas
- **Habitat Types** — Bright, Cool, Dark, Dry, Humid, Warm — never cross habitat lines in housing
